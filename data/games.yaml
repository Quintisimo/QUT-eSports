Overwatch:
  image: img/games/overwatch/overwatch.jpg
  about: Overwatch is a team-oriented multiplayer online first-person shooter video game created by Blizzard Entertainment. It has a unique lore and timeline, with all the characters in the game having unique storylines and interactions with each other. Each character has a distinct personality and varying play styles which allows different team compositions to be created.
  strategy: In a game each team has 6 people playing different characters in order to defend or attack an objective. These objectives differ from map to map. Assault maps have two points that the attacking team must capture in order to win the game with the defending team trying to stop them under a time limit. Escort maps usually requires the attacking team to deliver a payload to a certain point before time runs out while the defending team tries to stop them. Control maps require each team to capture and then control the point until the percentage indicator reaches 100%.

Rocket League:
  image: img/games/rocket league/rocket league.jpg
  about: Rocket League is a team based game in which players use rocket-powered cars to play soccer. Each team consists of one to four players with the ultimate objective of scoring more goals than the opposing team. Due to itâ€™s popularity and competitive nature Rocket League has been adopted as an eSport in which professional players participating through ESL and Major League Gaming matches along with Psyonix's own Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS).
  strategy: It is a highly strategic game that needs focus and high communication. Communication is the back bone of a strong team and is a very important skill. Players who can communicate effectively make for strong teammates. Along with communication, consistency is everything when it comes to Rocket League. If players are able to be consistent at hitting shots and defending goals it builds onto the foundation of a successful team.
