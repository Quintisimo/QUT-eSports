  about: League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena which incorporates real-time strategy and roleplaying elements created by Riot Games. The game is set within its own universe called Runeterra and each character have their own unique lore and storyline which interconnects with other characters.
  strategy: Every member of the team chooses a single character to play for the entirety of the game. There are many different classes to choose from, such as mage, assassin, tank, support, and marksman. Each class has a different role within the team (for example, the support class is usually tasked with protecting and helping the main damage dealers of the team). Characters are able to level up and gain abilities by killing minions, which also provides in-game gold to purchase items that increase their attributes such as damage and armour. Neutral monsters which give different buffs are able to be slain. The game is won by destroying the enemy team's structures then destroying the enemy team's nexus, which is placed at their base.

  banner: img/games/overwatch/banner.jpg
  about: Overwatch is a team-oriented, first-person shooter created by Blizzard Entertainment. It has a unique lore and timeline where each character has their own distinct personality, storyline and play styles. Players will need to consider this when creating teams in order to create the best possible team combination for each situation.
  strategy: In a game, each team consists of six (6) players using different characters in order to attack, or defend, the objective(s) depending on the map. There are currently four (4) map types, all with varying objectives. Assault maps have two (2) points which the attacking team must capture in order to win. During this time the defending teams goal is to stop the attacking team until timer reaches zero. Escort maps require the attacking team to escort a payload to the end of the map before time runs out. Meanwhile the defending team has to stop them from reaching this zone within the time limit. Hybrid maps consist of a capture point and a shortened payload phase. The attacking team must capture the payload first, then escort it to the end of the map, much like a regular Escort map. The final game mode is Control. Control maps require each team to capture and then maintain control a central point until the percentage indicator reaches 100%. Each control match has three (3) separate maps, using a best of three (3) format to determine the winning team.

  about: Hearthstone is a free-to-play strategy card game created by Blizzard Entertainment. Although the characters in Hearthstone are from Warcraft (also a game by Blizzard Entertainment), it is completely beginner friendly with tutorials and explanations for each card and character.
  strategy: In a typical game, two players will duke it out using a deck of cards in which they have constructed from cards received in-game. There are four main types of cards in Hearthstone, which have different unique traits. These include Spell cards, Weapon cards, Minion cards and Hero cards. For example, a Minion card has attack and defence points which can be used to either attack or defend the life points of a player. Whereas, a Spell card could cast a ‘Secret’, which is a hidden effect that only triggers once a set of specific conditions are met. Each card comes with a tooltip which explains how the card works.
