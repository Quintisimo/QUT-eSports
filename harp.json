        "about": "Overwatch is a team-oriented multiplayer online first-person shooter video game created by Blizzard Entertainment. Overwatch has a unique lore and timeline, with all the characters in the game having unique storylines and interactions with each other. Each character has a distinct personality and varying play styles, which allows different team compositions to be created.",
        "strategy": "In each game, each team has 6 people playing different characters in order to defend or attack an objective. These objectives differ from map to map. Assault maps have two points that the attacking team must capture in order to win the game, with the defending team trying to stop them under a time limit. Escort objective maps usually requires the attacking team to deliver a payload to a certain point before time runs out, while the defending team tries to stop them. Control maps require each team to capture and then control the point until the percentage indicator reaches 100%.",
        "goals": "QUT Overwatch is a group that is dedicated to bringing people together in their mutual love for Overwatch. We strive to create an environment that encourages teamwork and driving one another to improve. ",

For example, the support class is usually tasked with protecting and helping the main damage dealers of the team. Characters are able to level up and gain abilities by killing minions, which also provides in-game gold to purchase items that increase character attributes such as damage and armour. Neutral monsters which give different buffs are able to be slain. The most powerful neutral monster is the Baron Nashor, which gives the team to slay it a powerful buff such as increased health regeneration. The game is won by destroying the enemy team's structures such as towers, then destroying the enemy team's nexus which is placed at their base.",
